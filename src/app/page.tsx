        <p className="mb-2">
          The FIFA Ranking uses the ELO rating system to calculate the relative strength of players.
          ELO is a widely adopted method that considers the outcome of matches and the strength of opponents to adjust rankings.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Each player starts with an initial ELO rating of 1000. When two teams face off, the expected outcome is determined based on their ratings.
          So it's quite simple, if lower-rated player wins, he gains more points, whereas a higher-rated player gains fewer points for a win. A draw leads to points being shared.
